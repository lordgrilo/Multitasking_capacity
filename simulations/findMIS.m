%findMIS is an heuristic algorithm for solving Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS).
%Algorithm run in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of vertices (worst case).
%Experimentally: time = 8.1e-007*n^2 + 2.2e-005*n + 0.00012 seconds, (see screenshot)
%An independent set of a graph is a subset of vertices in which no two vertices are
%adjacent. Given a set of vertices, the maximum independent set problem calls 
%for finding the independent set of maximum cardinality.

%The algorithm has been independently developped but is similar to:
%Balaji, Swaminathan, Kannan, "A Simple Algorithm to Optimize 
%Maximum Independent Set", Advanced Modeling and Optimization, Volume 12, Number 1, 2010

%Notation:
%The neighborhood of v is defined by N(v) ={u in V such that u is adjacent to v}
%The DEGREE of a vertex v in V, denoted by deg(v) and is defined by the number of
%neighbors of v.
%The SUPPORT of a vertex v in V is defined by the sum of the degree of the vertices 
%which are adjacent to v, i.e., support(v) = s(v) = sum( deg(u) ) where u are all 
%vertices in N(v).

%INPUTS:
% "AD" is the adjacency matrix. It must be of logicals values!
% "priority" is used to break the ties (parity) situations that occur when more than one 
% max set can be selected. Consider for example the trivial case of two nodes connected  
% by one edge: there are two possible maximum independent set. By using priority you can 
% decide which vertex has to selected first.
% Try for example:
% x=findMIS(logical([0 1; 1 0]),[1 2]) %Higher priority to node 1
% and
% x=findMIS(logical([0 1; 1 0]),[2 1]) %Higher priority to node 2 

%OUTPUTS:
%x is an binary array where x(i)=1 if vertex i belongs to the Maximum independent set
% and x(i)=0 if belongs to the Minimum vertex cover.
